# Kidney-Detection

# **Project overview**

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem with high morbidity and
mortality rate, and it induces other diseases. Since there are no obvious values during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients
to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning
models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition
performance. In this study, we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD.
The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning
repository, which has a large number of missing values. Preprocessing was used to fill in the
missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to
process the missing data for each incomplete sample. Missing values are usually seen in real-life
medical situations because patients may miss some measurements for various reasons. After
effectively filling out the incomplete data set, machine learning algorithm ( , random ) were used
to establish models. Among these machine learning models; random forest achieved the best
performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy.

## Application Features
This Website uses  many techniques and algorithms and all other various tools to build a system
which predicts the disease of the patient using the values and by taking those values we are
comparing with the system’s dataset that is previously available.
By taking those datasets and comparing with the patient’s disease we will predict the
accurate percentage disease of the patient. The dataset and values go to the prediction model of
the system where the data is pre-processed for the future references and then the feature selection
is done by the user where he will enter the various values.
